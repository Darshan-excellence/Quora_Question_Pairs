# Quora_Question_Pairs
Quora Question Pairs competition! Here, our goal is to identify which questions asked on Quora, a quasi-forum website with over 100 million visitors a month, are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful, for example, to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not, and submitting a binary prediction against the logloss metric.
